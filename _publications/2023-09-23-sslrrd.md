title: "Self-Supervised Learning of Speech Representation via Redundancy Reduction"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-09-23-sslrrd
excerpt: 'This work aims to investigate a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) method for speech representation that leverages redundancy reduction techniques to learn robust representations capturing speaker characteristics. Our proposed approach builds upon the Barlow Twins framework, introduced in computer vision, and we adapt it to speech processing. The primary objective is to assess the quality of the learned representations through comprehensive evaluations of various downstream tasks, including speaker identification, gender recognition, emotion recognition, and more.'
