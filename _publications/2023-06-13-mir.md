excerpt: 'We propose a theoretical framework for biological recognition, integrating category theory, information theory, dynamical systems modeling, and optimization theory. This framework defines individual recognition (IR) and class-level recognition (CR) as functors between stimuli and responses. We identify five conditions for robust IR systems, termed "signature systems," and model them as attractor states, offering insights into communication and language evolution.'
