excerpt: 'In our research, we utilized Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as a principal diagnostic tool in radiology to detect soft tissue abnormalities, particularly in the brain. To address the laborious process of manually interpreting a large number of MRI scans, we developed a framework using Machine Learning methodologies. Our approach, based on Deep Transfer Learning and the Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet50) architecture, achieved remarkable classification accuracies of 86.40% on our dataset, 93.80% on the Harvard Whole Brain Atlas dataset, and an impressive 97.05% accuracy on the School of Biomedical Engineering dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed transfer learning framework for multi-classification of brain tumors in MRI images, offering a potential and impactful method to improve medical diagnosis in radiology.'
