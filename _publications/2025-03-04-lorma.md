excerpt: 'Medical imaging datasets pose challenges in storage, transmission, and analysis due to their complexity. Low-rank matrix approximation (LORMA) and its variant, LLORMA, offer efficient data representation, with LLORMA gaining preference since 2015 for capturing structural details. This review examines their applications, limitations in similarity measurement, and the potential of semantic segmentation for improvement. We also explore their extension to structured data, the impact of missing values, and propose a hybrid optimization approach to enhance patch selection and overall applicability in medical imaging.'
