excerpt: 'In this study, we investigate the impact of different formulations of the Barlow Twins (BT) objective on downstream task performance for speech data, proposing Modified Barlow Twins (MBT) with normalized latents to enforce scale-invariance, and our results demonstrate that MBT improves representation generalization over original BT, particularly when fine-tuning with limited target data, highlighting the importance of designing objectives that encourage invariant and transferable representations for self-supervised speech representations.'
