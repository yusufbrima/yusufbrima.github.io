excerpt: 'We evaluated attribution methods to illuminate how deep neural networks analyze medical images, using adaptive path-based gradient integration to attribute predictions from brain tumor MRI and COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets, highlighting possible biomarkers, exposing model biases, and offering insights into the links between input and prediction, demonstrating the method's ability to elucidate model reasoning and improve deep learning transparency for domain experts by revealing the rationale behind predictions.'
