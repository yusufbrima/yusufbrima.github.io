Poster title: "Supervised Contrastive Deep Learning for Individual Recognition in Chimpanzees in the Wild
" This talked peered into the study of the origin of human language as a communicative tool. It narrowed down on Individual Recogntition (IR) -- the ability of an individual (a receiver) to uniquely identify another individual (a signaler) based on signature cues, a ubiquitous practice of animals that live in fission-fusion systems. IR is crucial to startification of groups, formation of trust and behaviour direction towards others. This talk connect the problem of IR from the perpective of a receiver as an computational problem modelled using deep learning.
