Course Overview
==================
This seminar focuses on **Deep Representation Learning**, exploring how deep neural networks acquire hierarchical and versatile representations during training. The course combines theoretical insights with practical applications, guiding students through the process of analyzing, evaluating, and improving representations in deep learning models. Participants will reproduce and adapt research papers, write scientific reports, and present their findings.

### Key Topics
- Analysis and evaluation of deep neural network representations
- Methods for improving interpretability and reusability of representations
- Comparison of representations across different networks
- Learning task-specific vs. universal representations

### Course Structure
The seminar is project-oriented, with students working in groups to reproduce and adapt research papers. The course is divided into 13 sessions, including lectures, student presentations, and hands-on support sessions. Key milestones include:
- **Exposé/Proposal Presentation**: Students present their project ideas and plans.
- **Project Idea Presentations**: Students share their progress and challenges.
- **Final Presentations**: Students present their completed projects and findings.

### Prerequisites
- Background in deep learning (e.g., ANNs with TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Familiarity with linear algebra, statistics, and information theory
- Experience with a deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
