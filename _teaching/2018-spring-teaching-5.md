Course objectives: 
==================
* To expose the basic concepts of system - design, implementation, and management
* To provide an overview on computerized application program, terminology, conventions, and procedures
* To developing structured program logic


Course Outcomes: 
================
Students will acquire the abilities to:

* Understand the basic concepts of system
* Explain the computerized application program, terminology, conventions, and procedures
* Design and develop structured algorithm of a program logic by using pseudocode and flowchart

SPECIFIC GENERIC LEARNING SKILLS
================================

* At the end of the module, students are expected to acquire the following skills: 
* To develop and understand a complete program design
