Course objectives: 
==================
* To understand and describe syntax and semantics of programming languages
* To understand data, data types, and basic statements 
* To understand call-return architecture and ways of implementing them
* To understand object-orientation, concurrency, and event handling in programming
languages
* To develop programs in non-procedural programming paradigms

Course Outcomes: 
================
Upon Completion of the course, the students will be able to 
* Describe syntax and semantics of programming languages
* Explain data, data types, and basic statements of programming languages 
* Design and implement subprogram constructs, Apply object - oriented, concurrency, and
event handling  programming constructs
* Develop programs in Scheme, ML, and Prolog
* Understand and adopt new programming languages

SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS:
=====================
Evolution of programming languages, describing syntax, context,free grammars, attribute
 grammars, describing semantics, lexical analysis, parsing, recursive - decent bottom - up
parsing

DATA, DATA TYPES, AND BASIC STATEMENTS:
=======================================
Names, variables, binding, type checking, scope, scope rules, lifetime and garbage collection, primitive data types, strings,
array types, associative arrays, record types, union types,  pointers and references,
Arithmetic expressions, overloaded operators, type conversions, relational and boolean
expressions , assignment statements , mixed mode assignments, control structures -
selection, iterations, branching, guarded Statements

SUBPROGRAMS AND IMPLEMENTATIONS:
================================
Subprograms, design issues, local referencing, parameter passing,  overloaded methods, generic methods, design issues for functions, semantics of call and return, implementing simple  subprograms, stack and dynamic local variables, nested subprograms, blocks, dynamic scoping 

OBJECT- ORIENTATION, CONCURRENCY, AND EVENT HANDLING:
=====================================================
Object - orientation, design issues for  OOP languages, implementation of object, oriented constructs, concurrency, semaphores,  Monitors, message passing, threads, statement level concurrency, exception handling, event handling
