My experience was great personally and professionally. As I am very passionate about traveling and meeting people from different cultures, I learned a lot about the country and the people of Bangladesh. I still maintain ties with some friends from here.

As everyone has very different lived experiences and would be exposed to varied circumstances as things change over time. So, any suggestion I give you has to be cautiously considered.  I left the University of Dhaka almost two years ago, and administrative and academic processes have evolved to adjust to the new normal of COVID-19.

Nonetheless, one primary thing I could advise you on, though that may depend on your department/cohort/professors, is to be prepared for language difficulties. Though the official language may be English, your classmate could be predominately Bangla-fluent.  So, if it's possible to reach out to students/former students of the department where you are going, not the international office, those students would paint the real picture for you.

If you haven't traveled to South Asia, especially the Sub-Indian continent before, also consider learning a fair bit of their culture, traditions, and values. This will help you greatly avoid the pitfall of culture shock. I and many others (unwittingly faced that). A few lookups of online blogs can give you a sense of the people and their culture. You will enjoy the experience if you are open as people in Bangladesh are very welcoming and are curious to know about foreigners. So, don't be offended if someone along the read or a rickshaw puller asks you "brother where do you come from?!" instead of initiating a courtesy greeting. This just shows a buzzer in anticipation and friendliness people have there. If you immerse yourself in the culture enough, you could have a busy calendar of activities from traditional wedding ceremonies to Muslim/Hindu festivities and numerous national events. Remember this is a vital component of your scholarship as it allows you to network and learns the culture as well as bring forward your country's culture.

Also, as a public university in a middle-income country, things might be a bit slower. Dhaka University is not only the oldest in the country but among the oldest in the sub-Continent. Amid the rapid informatization, administrative work may be a bit slow primary due to the plentiful bureaucratic procedures that ought to be completed for mundane and not-so-mundane tasks such as examination registration, mark sheet, ID issuance e.t.c. Bear in mind, that your department, especially the Chairperson will always be at your aid. All you have to do is ask for help. People are always willing and happy to give you support to make your stay a nice experience.

ou will most likely stay at the Sir P. J. Hartog International Hall, a hostel for international students and staff. Students, there are from varied countries across Asia and sparingly Africa and Europe. At the end of my QECS, there was a scholar, Harry, from the U.K. who was studying linguistics. So, there will always be people to befriend there.

In the case of immigration, also remember your department Chair is of invaluable support as well as the International Help Desk. They can be very helpful with visa application/renewal. Police clearance certificate (if you're going to ever need one), as well as an opening a student bank account where your stipend and other financial correspondences will be done.

In summary, make the most out of this life-changing opportunity. Though matter what hurdles you face, remember your mission. You were chosen amongst the many applicants because you have unique potential.  There are many things, I could touch on but in case you have any specific questions always feel free to reach out, I will be happy to help you where I can.
