      <p style='text-align:justify;'>
    The democratization of the Internet has opened vistas of opportunities for young people coming from underprivileged backgrounds to gain scholarships for further studies. This massive outpour of information has also saturated facts with fiction about what it takes to gain a prestigious scholarship programme amid the ever-growing competitiveness among candidates for a few slots of opportunities. Thus, our aim in this webinar, the first of its kind (at least to our knowledge for the West African context), is to distil the essence of a scholarship, the does and don't in one's quest to get a scholarship and a general thinking paradigm to have to become a successful scholar. The paradigm in question is <b>problem-solving and leadership-oriented</b> ways to thinking because to be successful, one has to be so in the selfless service to humankind.
