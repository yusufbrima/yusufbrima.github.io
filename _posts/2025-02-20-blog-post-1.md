### **Comprehensive Overview of the Tool Stack**  

Based on Martin’s emails, here is an overview of the tools and frameworks used across different stages of the workflow, from data preprocessing to model development and deployment. I've also included learning resources to help you familiarize yourself with each tool.  

---

## **1. Data Preprocessing**  
This involves handling raw MRI scans in **DICOM/NIfTI** format and preparing them for model training.  

### **Tools Used:**  
- **DICOM/NIfTI Processing:**  
  - **[Nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)** – For reading and writing neuroimaging file formats (NIfTI, Analyze, etc.).  
  - **[pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/)** – For handling DICOM files in Python.  
- **Custom Preprocessing in InteractiveVis** – Their in-house development includes preprocessing MRI scans.  

### **Where to Learn:**  
- [DICOM Basics and Processing with pydicom](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tommyngx/dicom-basic-preprocessing-in-python)  
- [NIfTI and Neuroimaging with NiBabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/nibabel_images.html)

## **2. Model Development & Interpretation**  
The main deep learning framework is **TensorFlow 2.15**, but they also explored **PyTorch** alternatives. The focus is on **layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)** for model interpretability.  

### **Tools Used:**  
- **TensorFlow 2.15 & iNNvestigate** (for LRP-based interpretability)  
  - **[iNNvestigate](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate/)** – A library for interpretability methods in neural networks, tied to TensorFlow.  
- **AUCMEDI** (for data generators)  
  - **[AUCMEDI](https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/aucmedi/)** – A data augmentation pipeline for medical images, linked to TensorFlow.  
- **PyTorch (alternative, but not yet fully integrated)**  
  - **[Captum](https://captum.ai/)** – PyTorch library for interpretability (Integrated Gradients, LRP, etc.), though it didn't match iNNvestigate's results.  

### **Where to Learn:**  
- [TensorFlow 2.15 Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/)  
- [iNNvestigate Documentation](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate)  
- [AUCMEDI GitHub](https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/aucmedi/I)  
- [Captum for PyTorch Interpretability](https://captum.ai/tutorials/)

## **3. Visualization & Interactive Exploration**  
For visualizing model outputs and making insights interactive.  

### **Tools Used:**  
- **Bokeh (for App UI, but using old TensorFlow 1.15)**  
  - **[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)** – Interactive visualization library for web applications.  
- **Plotly (for OntoVis, ontology-based visualization)**  
  - **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)** – Python library for interactive visualizations.  
- **PowerPoint (for summarizing results and explanations)**  

### **Where to Learn:**  
- [Bokeh Interactive Visualization](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/)  
- [Plotly Python Tutorials](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/)  

---

## **4. Deployment & Inference**  
The deployment workflow includes running inference on trained models with compatibility constraints between TensorFlow versions.  

### **Challenges & Solutions:**  
- **Versioning issues:**  
  - TF2.15 models need to be manually translated to TF1.15 for inference in **InteractiveVis**.  
- **Inference Pipeline:**  
  - Uses **InteractiveVis**, their new internal tool for handling MRI scans.  

### **Where to Learn:**  
- [Managing TensorFlow Versioning Issues](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/upgrade)
