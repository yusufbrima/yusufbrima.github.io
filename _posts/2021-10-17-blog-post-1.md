Introduction to physical/dynamical process modelling
======
<p style="text-align:justify;">
In our day to day lives, a lot of natural and artificial phenomena can be described and/ or explained using Mathematical tools. Many of these phenomena change with time, some in  a more sophisticated way compared to others. This inspires the modelling of such systems termed to as Dynamical Systems. Dynamical Systems can range from simple interaction of predators and preys in a habitat, for example the variation of the population of foxes and rabbits, to viral spread (such as COVID-19) in a population. The set of mathematical tools used to model such systems allow us, we mean, any one with a fair bit of motivation and access of a modern computer programming environment, to model and make meaningful predictions of the time-evolving properties if such systems. That's why, modelling techniques of dynamical systems are extensively used in engineering, economics, epidemiology, physics  and many more disciplines.

However, the factors and variables determine the cumbersomeness of the dynamical system under consideration. These systems behavior can be interpreted to the re-known differential equations from which further examinations can be done to well explain how these systems behave.

Differential Equations (Ordinary and Partial

<p style="text-align:justify;">
 If you are a numbers nerd or have an inclination to mathematics, odds are, you may have come across this linchpin of modern mathematics. If not, be rest assured, because you are about to learn something profound which will change your view of the world around you. If you are wondering, we are not exaggerating! Thus, in this blog, we want to journey with you into the amazing beauty and power of this approach to model time-varying systems. So, what is a differential equation? A differential equation (often abbreviated DE) can be defined as an equation that contains one or more functions of one independent variable and their corresponding derivatives. So, if you are acquainted with functions and and high school calculus (i.e., differential and integral), we are in a better footing if not, don't worry. Learn the basics of <a href = "https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function.html"> functions </a>  and <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-introduction.html"> derivatives </a> and come back and continue. Differential equations range from ordinary to partial. The generic form of a differential equation is thus:
</p>
$$
\begin{equation}
     \frac{d \mathbf{x}}{d t}=f(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d},
     \label{eq:differential_equation}
 \end{equation}
$$
with initial value $\mathbf{x}\left(t_{0}\right)=\mathbf{x}_{0}$. As mentioned above, ordinary differential equation (ODE) is one of types of DEs. It is called ordinary because it entails a $\textbf{single independent variable}$ like $\textbf{x}$ in equation $\ref{eq:ode_sample}$.
$$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dy}{dx}=f(x).
    \label{eq:ode_sample}
\end{equation}
$$
