Introduction
======
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Welcome. We are going to embark on a journey, together, of course in gaining a deeper intuion of sound and it's general application to machine learning problems from simple toy use cases like intrumental classification to advanced Music Information Retrieval (MIR). This is going to be a series of post that will delve into the mysterious world of sound and how it's ubiquity of applications. This blog is greatly inspired by <a href="https://valeriovelardo.com/" target="_blank">Valerio Velardo</a>, who continues to lower the learning curve of Machine Learning in the Audio space.

Yes, you are right to be wondering how for heaven's sake (assuming you believe in one), I ended up here talking my head about audio. Well, it's a long story and it's best we save the details for another day! I was recruited into a PhD programme in evolutionary biology where state-of-the-art ML tools need to be used in automating information processing: from vocal signature analysis to speaker diarisation and everything in between. So, that was my journey to the great awakening in this world of Audio Signal Processing and Machine Learning, yes not Deep Learning. Justifications will clear later on.
