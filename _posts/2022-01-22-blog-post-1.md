<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Welcome. We are going to embark on a journey, together, of course in gaining a deeper intuion of sound and it's general application to machine learning problems from simple toy use cases like intrumental classification to advanced Music Information Retrieval (MIR). This is going to be a series of post that will delve into the mysterious world of sound and how it's ubiquity of applications. This blog is greatly inspired by <a href="https://valeriovelardo.com/" target="_blank">Valerio Velardo</a>, who continues to lower the learning curve of Machine Learning in the Audio space.

Yes, you are right to be wondering how for heaven's sake (assuming you believe in one), I ended up here talking my head about audio. Well, it's a long story and it's best we save the details for another day! I was recruited into a PhD programme in evolutionary biology where state-of-the-art ML tools need to be used in automating information processing: from vocal signature analysis to speaker diarisation and everything in between. So, that was my journey to the great awakening in this world of Audio Signal Processing and Machine Learning, yes not Deep Learning. Justifications will clear later on.

<h2>What is sound?</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Have you heard of the famous quote by Nikola Tesla: “If you wish to understand the Universe think of energy, frequency and vibration.“ I have a tingling he was right. If we take a multiscale view of everything around us, from the macrocismic view of the spiral expanding universe to the wiggling dance of subatomic participles at the Planc scale, these three phenomina are at play all the time. And so you may be wondering how does that relate to sound. Well, it certainly does relate to sound in every way one could imagine. A sound is created when a physical system vibrates. This vibration may be caused when a physical system is displaced from its equilibrium condition and is allowed to respond to the forces that tend to restore equilibrium. A simple manifestation of <a href="https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/newtons-laws-of-motion/"> Isaac Newton's laws of Motion</a>. This vibration causes a differential change in air pressure around the local region that produced the vibration. The pressure oscillates and propagates in the medium where the vibration occured for example through the air. Thus, sound is a wave, a longitudinal wave that carries energy. But a wave is a disturbance of a medium which transports vibrational energy through the medium without permanently transporting matter. This is very important because  in a wave, temporarily displaced particles of the medium return to rest when the energy dissipates. And example of this concept is shown in Figure 1 below.

    <figcaption> Figure 1: A simple vibration of a spring-mass physical system in a natual frequency (Source: PlainEnglish.io). The periodic graphic shows the displacement of air pressure over time. The high of the displacement is directly proportional to the applied external force, mass of the object attached, and stiffness of the spring. However, eventually the vibrational motion comes to rest.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
When a pysical system is at rest (i.e., all net forces  such as gravity, push or pull of a spring, acting on the body are balances meaning sum up to 0). Then the body is in an equilibrium state. However, a nudge an an object at equilibrium will tend to cause to system to vibrate proportionally to the applied force. This is the basis of oscillation,resonance and waves which are the crux of of studying sound consequently AI audio. But, let's don't get ahead of ourselves because the jigsaw puzzle is not solved yet, nonethe least completely.
To truely understand the theoretical basis of sound we need to traverse the landscapes of differential equations (DEs). Why DEs? Primarily because they study how the behaviour of systems change over time and that remarkably captures the beauty of our changing universe in elegant ways.
